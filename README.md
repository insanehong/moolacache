MoolaCache Demo Angular 5, TypeScript, FlexLayout
    Move your money into a barn and watch it grow

The ideal behind this demo is to teach money stewardship (budgeting) to kids.

Live Demo @ https://moola-cache.firebaseapp.com/

The demo is accessible from a desktop or mobile browser the UI is designed to be responsive to the
sizing of the browser window.

I built this demo because I wanted to learn more about the folowing:

Angular 5, Angular Material v2, @angular/flex-layout, Typescript

It uses Google Firebase for persistence.

Three ways to play around with the demo:

1. "Sign In" using the following account:

email: demo@domain.com
pass: 123456

or

2. "Sign Up" with a new email (the email doesn't have to be real) and password

or

3. Authenticate using your Google account. (this is a demo and it only uses the Google account to create a unique user id to keep your data separate from others data)
